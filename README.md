## About

The wealth of ancient myths and legends which we call `Classical Mythology` is one of the major elements of our cultural heritage. 
A huge amount of documents and photographs were assembled in the course of the preparation of the `Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae` (`LIMC`; 1981-1999 and 2009) and the `Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum` (`ThesCRA`; 2004-2014). 
The dataset provided by this project is regularly updated and enhanced with new documents.

[weblimc.org](http://www.weblimc.org) gives access to the digital resources (ca. 50'000 ancient objects and photographs) provided by three components of the late foundation for the `LIMC`:

- **Digital LIMC**: the archives of the Foundation for the LIMC that have been transfered to the University of Basel.

- **LIMC France**: digital ressources on Greek, Etruscan and Roman iconography and objects

- **LIMC Greece**: data on objects from recent excavations in Greece.
